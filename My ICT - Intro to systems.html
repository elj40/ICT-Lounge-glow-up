				<h3><strong>Key Concepts of this section:</strong></h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Understand the <strong>purpose</strong> of systems analysis and design.</li>
					<li>Be able to <strong>name the six stages</strong> of systems analysis and design.</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>Introduction to systems analysis and design</h3>
			<hr>
			<div class="inner-content a">
				<h4>What is the purpose of systems analysis and design</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><p>This is the process of looking at an existing system and then <strong>designing a new system that can carry out the same tasks better</strong> (e.g. a payroll system or billing system).</p></li>
					<li><p>If a system is <strong>developed without proper planning or design</strong>, serious <strong>faults and defects</strong> are usually found in the system later on when it has been built.</p></li>
					<li><p>Any faults discovered once the system has been built are very expensive and time-consuming to correct.</p></li>
					<li><p>By carrying out <strong>proper planning</strong> (systems analysis and design) before starting to build the system, these <strong>potential faults are minimised</strong>.</p></li>
				</ul>
				<hr>
			</div>
			
			<div class="inner-content b">
				<h4>What is the 'Systems Analysis' part?</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><p>This is where the <strong>existing system</strong> is <strong>looked at (analysed) in detail</strong> and improvements are suggested.</p></li>
				</ul>

				<div class="box">
					<ol>
						<strong>Existing systems that need to be improved are usually one of the following:

						<li><p>A paper-based system with no current use of computers at all</p></li>
						<li><p>Computer-based system that is no longer good enough to handle the task.</p></li>

						</strong>
					</ol>
				</div>
				<hr>
			</div>
			<div class="inner-content c">
				<h4>What is the 'Design' part?</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><p>This is where <strong>detailed plans are created</strong> for the proposed new system.</p></li>
					<li><p>The plans are carefully produced to make sure that the proposed system will carry out it's intended purpose. They also help to <strong>minimise faults and errors </strong></p></li>
					<li><p>These plans are like <strong>'blueprints'</strong> for the system developers to follow.</p></li>

			<div class="inner-content d">
				<h4>What are the six stages of systems analysis and design?</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><p>The six stages (abbreviated to <strong>ADDIDE</strong>) are completed in the following order:</p></li>
				</ul>
				<div class="box">
					<div>
						<ol>
							<li><p><strong>Analysis<br />
							</strong>Look at the existing system and find improvements</p></li>
							<li><p><strong>Design</strong><br />Plan the proposed new system</p></li>
							<li><p><strong>Development and Testing</strong><br />
							Create the new system and test it</p></li>
							<li><p><strong>Implementation<br /></strong>
							Place the new system into the company</p></li>
							<li><p><strong>Documentation<br /></strong>
							Create user-guides for every day users and those who will develop it further</p></li>
							<li><p><strong>Evaluation<br /></strong>
							Decide how well the new system is working</p></li>
